# **TheHarvester — OSINT Email & Host Discovery**

TheHarvester gathers:

- Emails
    
- Hostnames
    
- Subdomains
    
- URLs
    
- Public IPs
    

from services like Google, Bing, Shodan, etc.

### **Concept**

It scrapes public internet sources — pure passive recon.

### **Example**

`theharvester -d target.com -b all`

### **Tips**

- Great for Corp-style CTF challenges.
    
- If you see emails, think: password spraying → social engineering → password patterns.
