## üîê What is ROT13?

**ROT13 (rotate by 13 places)** is a simple letter substitution cipher that replaces each letter with the **13th letter after it** in the alphabet.

- `A` becomes `N`, `B` becomes `O`, ..., `M` becomes `Z`
    
- `N` becomes `A`, `O` becomes `B`, ..., `Z` becomes `M`
    

‚úÖ It works on both uppercase and lowercase letters  
‚ùå It **does not affect numbers, symbols, or punctuation**

As you can see when we read the data.txt we see the rotated or cipher text. 
Since we already know it is rot 13 from the description we will just use online tool i mention before which is cyberchef

As you can see we got the password 

we can also do this in terminal but that would just take time and complicated but anyways lets try that but remember we should always choose speed for solving something coz it matters in the ctf Challenges

we can still do it in the terminal but not faster compared to the first method
