###  Challenge:

> The password for the next level is stored in the file `data.txt`, which contains **a Base64 encoded string**.

---

### üìÇ Step 1: View the file contents


`cat data.txt`

#### Output:

`VGhlIHBhc3N3b3JkIGlzIGR0UjE3M2ZaS2IwUlJzREZTR3NnMlJXbnBOVmozcVJyCg==`

---

### üß† Step 2: Decode the Base64 string

You can use `echo` and pipe it into `base64 -d`:

`echo "VGhlIHBhc3N3b3JkIGlzIGR0UjE3M2ZaS2IwUlJzREZTR3NnMlJXbnBOVmozcVJyCg==" | base64 -d`

#### Output:

`The password is dtR173fZKb0RRsDFSGsg2RWnpNVj3qRr`

### üõ†Ô∏è Notes:

- Base64 is just **encoding**, not encryption ‚Äî you don‚Äôt need a key to decode it.
    
- Strings ending in `=` or `==` are often Base64 ‚Äî a big hint during CTFs or pentesting.
    
- You can also decode directly from a file:
    
    `base64 -d data.txt`


**Another Method** 

- There are many websites that can decode base64
